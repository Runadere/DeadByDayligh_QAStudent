Reflection

Capturing this issue was difficult, the first few times it occurred I either didn't capture it, only caught a flicker of distortion so wasn't sure if it was an issue, and more importantly; the conditions which this issue needs to happen are very precise - there's no guarantee these conditions will be met in a match. Add to that there are 32 killers with their own unique powers, addons, mechanics, 38 survivors, 237 perks (109 killer, 128 survivor) - and you have to consider the possibility and depth of combinations perk wise on both sides.
