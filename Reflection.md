Reflection

Capturing this issue was difficult, the first few times it occurred I either didn't capture it, only caught a flicker of distortion so wasn't sure if it was an issue, and more importantly; the conditions which this issue needs to happen are very precise - there's no guarantee these conditions will be met in a match. Add to that there are 32 killers with their own unique powers, addons, mechanics; 38 survivors, 237 perks (109 killer, 128 survivor) - and you have to consider the possibility and depth of combinations perk wise on both sides.

The discovery was purely accidental, but as Distortion is one of my go to survivor perks, it was a lucky find; and then a lot of matches trying to force reproduction! It was a challenge trying to write the reproduction steps, while simple on the surface, thereâ€™s a tremendous amount of interactions that can occur, and it was a fine line writing for someone who may have zero experience of the game; and leaning too hard with the assumption the reader already understands the game. A massive positive, which I've included, is confirmation from BHVR that there was an issue with Distortion.
